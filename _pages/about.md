## Selected Publications (CCF A Venues)

### 1. Counterfactual Reasoning for Steerable Pluralistic Value Alignment of Large Language Models  
**NeurIPS 2025 (CCF A, Poster)**  
Hanze Guo, Jing Yao, Xiao Zhou, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie  
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18526)  

We propose **COUPLE**, a counterfactual reasoning framework for steerable pluralistic value alignment of large language models, supporting fine-grained control over pluralistic human values via structural causal models and counterfactual sampling.

### 2. SoREX: Towards Self-Explainable Social Recommendation with Relevant Ego-Path Extraction  
**ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 2025 (CCF A)**  
Hanze Guo, Yijun Ma, Xiao Zhou  
[ACM DL](https://doi.org/10.1145/3777374) · [Code](https://github.com/antman9914/SoREX)

We develop **SoREX**, a self-explainable GNN-based social recommendation framework that extracts factor-specific ego-paths as human-understandable explanations while maintaining strong recommendation accuracy.
